          <h1 class="text-center">Conclusion</h1>
          <p> When starting my research, I was originally confused that Oxman, a brilliant scientist and designer, is known as an architect. She would be better known as an architect of the future; the tools she needs to build do not yet exist. Since then, I have learned that to build the future, you must lay the foundation of the future in the present.  Oxman learned from how some of the most innovative works were never built because they were deemed too futuristic like Kiesler's Endless House. The line between science fiction and reality is the foundation built in the present. Since the future is a contingent of the present, if the tools for her vision do not exist today, her vision might be science fiction—unless she builds them herself. Looking at H.G. Well’s concept of a time machine, it would first take designing small mechanisms, finding the right “crystal,” testing different configurations of wires and levers, and assembling small prototypes. At all beginning stages, innovative  buildings  would not resemble a time machine. Similarly, Oxman’s works are not architectural products until she finds all the right pieces. The future takes time. While there is an increased focus on creating eco-friendly through taking inspiration from nature or directly mimicking natural processes, there has not been as much advancement on changing the fundamental building blocks of architecture. This is where Neri Oxman comes in by engineering sustainable materials that put nature first and places inhabitants in harmony with their habitat. </p>
          <p>Futurity can be controlled by accessing or denying the  flow and preservation of information. For example, Oxman’s works would not have been possible without her predecessor’s  knowledge and technologies. If the past was similar to societies in Fahrenheit 451 and 1984 where knowledge and languages were restricted, the present would not have been possible—nor is the future of Oxman’s vision. But in the same vein, to bring futuristic ideas into the present reality, there must be a break in the continuity of general consensus. Oxman would not have much innovative technologies or architectural philosophy if she did not break the traditional architectural mindset. </p>
