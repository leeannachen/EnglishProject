          <br>
          <p>Through my study of the text and related sources, I want to highlight that futurity is based on continuity. The past, present, and future  are all connected. The majority of the page will focus on how Oxman’s Aguahoja is in direct conversations with a variety of topics we have discussed in class. Oxman’s mission is to revitalize architecture fundamentally  through how buildings are built and with what. She promotes using materials that come from nature and will decompose back into nature, removing the abundant harmful and modular building materials currently in use today like cement and asbestos. While she draws inspiration from existing libraries of knowledge and ideas, she intends to bring science fiction into reality—to create a world where buildings can grow from abundant natural materials and decompose to enrich its environment; a world where houses are made of one molecular composition with various levels of concentration that exist as structural support, light and thermal control, and the cosmetic facets, all in one—that is the goal. The following are some themes I found within her work that connect directly to our class. </p>
          <br>
          <h3 class="text-center" >Neri Oxman and...           </h3>
          <h3> Immanuel Kant </h3>
          <p> Neri Oxman was inspired by Kiesler's <i>Endless House</i> (as seen above) because the house was designed to have one continuous wall, bending in ellipsoid forms and creating separate spaces without the need for a door. Both Kiesler and Oxman’s workflows include a sense of a priori. Kiesler described the 40 years he spent perfecting the idea of an endless structure, iterations after iterations. For Oxman, there is a sense of a priori that rises from the phrase she used: “all is expected, all is known.” There was a sense of innate nature that guided Oxman and her team. They experiment until there is a click of familiarity, of knowing that is the way it should be. A project can change at any point based on what feels right—not a particular experience or event is the cause. Kant's philosophy has been called a synthesis of rationalism and empiricism. From empiricism Kant takes the idea that knowledge is essentially knowledge of experience but rejects the idea that we cannot learn any necessary truths about experience. Kiesler worked on what he felt was right. There was a sense of innate nature that guided Kiesler and Oxman for decades, both operating in a very Kantian manner. </p>
          <br>
          <p>From another perspective, Ling is a researcher on the Mediated Matter team at the MIT Media Lab with the mission to change the way people think about the death of a material. This echoes the idea of deep ecosophy highlighted by Pearson in <i>Earth to Spirit</i>.  While shallow ecosophy pushes to stop pollution and the depletion of world resources, deep ecosophy calls for changing the way people think. Ling wants to change the architectural design philosophy by incorporating a decay component.  All of the Mediated Matter projects start from a molecular level where other architects start by choosing prefabricated materials. The willingness to create something new allows Oxman and Ling to select any material and engineer functionality to it.  Ling's statement is that it is not necessary to follow a standard path when wanting to change something. This is all possible when there is a fundamental shift in thinking that anything is possible, we just have not thought about it yet. This is a sense of guiding nature with knowledge that is not yet known but knowing that it exists.  The Kantian view would be the argument that what they are doing is getting closer to the essence of truth while current construction methods have deviated from that is truth.  </p>
          <br>

          <h3> John Locke </h3>
          <p> Oxman’s imagination and perspective on construction is reminiscent of John Locke’s tabula rasa, a clean slate. Neither process should be restricted by each other or historical methods. Each material should have endless potential to be something else or be used differently than before. The whole fabrication process was an implementation argument to not only create materials but also build the enabling technologies for it. Within the Mediated Matter Lab, every material is a tabula rasa. Each polymer and DNA is not constrained by their commonly accepted functions or structure but rather has the ability to be created for something completely different. The Aguahoja project not only sets the grounds for her research but also opens the doors of imagination for change makers.  </p>
          <br>

          <h3> Nature </h3>
          <p> There has been a motif of prophecies in nature within our readings. Excerpts from The Stoics Reader, described how people went to oracles to hear the messages of the gods. Nature is an extension of the godly realm. When people were unable to explain natural events, mythology abridged the gap by relating phenomenons to the gods. There is something said about the intrinsic power of nature. When learning about what caused the oracles’ spiritual episodes, we learned about the hallucinogenic elements released from the cracks of the earth that induced the prophecies—the words that shaped the future. In present times, Oxman is able to unfold the future through nature as well, using modern scientific advances. Like in history, Oxman turned towards the world, an artifact that has aged billions of years, for answers by using existing and creating new technologies to study, engineer, and print biopolymers.  </p>
          <br>

          <h3> Language </h3>
          <p> The labeling system for the Aguahoja artifact was very noteworthy. The small key diagram illustrates how thoughtful and well-designed the project is. The labeling system stressed the importance of language, design, and accessibility. The labeling system circles back to George Orwell’s 1984 emphasis on the importance of language, knowledge, and accessibility. Within Orwell’s novel, newspeaks were created to limit mental capacities in the form of expression and interaction; additionally, no one had access to linguistic artifacts to tell the truth apart from fallacy. The chokehold of the conceptual barrier and access to information allowed the future to be controlled by Big Brother.  In the Aguahoja project, Oxman’s intuitive system promotes the opposite of everything done by Big Brother.  The label enables interactions and questions by providing digestible information in a well-designed manner. The simple labeling system also reiterates the lab’s focus on design as well as futuristic technology. Without documentation, the continuity of the present project will not be able to connect and help enable future works. Thus, to build a better future, there must exist a continuous flow of knowledge from the past to the present to the future.  </p>
