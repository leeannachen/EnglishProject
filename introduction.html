          <p>
            When looking at this course last semester, I remember googling the term “futurity.” When starting my final project, I googled “futurity” again,  and I saw the second definition that I skimmed over before:  the “renewed or continuing existence.”  Futurity is an interesting concept because when we imagine the future, we think of boldness, a future beyond return. For example, H.G. Wells presented futurity through the year 100,080 when the future was reached by the first time-traveling vehicle: the time machine. When the Greeks went to the Oracle of Delphi, they asked about major events like war outcomes. While we might look towards the future to imagine major milestones or turning points, the future is actually a continuous existence of the present which extends from the past.  
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            From ancient philosophy to science fiction, we covered various topics like schools of thought, how people predict the future, usage of futurity as a vehicle for political statements about historical times, creations of multiple universes, and humanity’s emotional reflection projected into the future. When deciding on my final project, I was intrigued by the idea of the present—where we are, what we build, and how material ages—when approaching the future. I set on the idea of architecture—a necessity for survival, an embodiment of beauty, and a reflection of current considerations. How we design and build is a mixed depiction of how we want and expect the future to be. For example, the idea of a fallout shelter became popular during the Cold War with the fear of nuclear destruction. The Industrialization Revolution gave birth to the idea of a suburban neighborhood—an area full of modularized, prefabricated homes with affordable price tags. When I realized that a lot of architecture was reactive, responding to what has already happened or what is expected to happen, I set out to find someone who is bold enough to reverse engineer the process—a movement is created for the design, rather than a design created for a movement.  I wanted to find an architect who dares to bring futurity into the present, rather than waiting for the present to become the future. Thus, I stumbled on the works of Neri Oxman.

          <h3>Neri Oxman</h3>
          <p> 
            Neri Oxman is architecture with the mission of saving our planet through fundamentally changing the way we use and interact with materials. She states that “we must design our way out of [the destruction we caused]” (quoted in Neville, 2019). Oxman sets the tone that her work must do justice to the environment by creating sustainable material, design, and build. Her vision is beyond what current technologies have to offer; thus, she has to make her own tools to achieve her design. Instead of confining herself to the material that exists today to design the spaces of tomorrow, she brings a new future through first building her foundation of futurist tools and materials. Like the Time Traveler, Oxman is assembling her materials to build something that transcends the current times. As a tenured professor at the MIT Media Lab, Oxman founded the discipline “Material Ecology”  and established a team at MIT’s Media Lab to study the relationship between the natural and biological built environments by using computational design, digital fabrication, material science and synthetic biology.

            Unlike a traditional research, design, or even architectural team, her team consists of “a biomedical engineer, a glass blower, a material scientist, a computer scientist whose specialty is wet artificial intelligence, an architect, a marine biologist and [a] beekeeper, among other specialists” (Green, 2018).  Oxman has worked on a range of projects from bee swarm fabrication studies to Nano-Enhanced Elastomers. These projects revolved around the thesis of how a designed object could respond to its environment both formally and functionally. Oxman discovered that the argument of form or function was missing a key ingredient: pheromones. “Form follows pheromones,” Oxman states and the studying of how a natural ecosystem operates will give us the information to create the materials and space needed for our exponentially changing environments. Oxman and her team knew that the queen secretes pheromones that dictate what the colony produces and where. Unlocking the mystery can be extremely useful in conserving the rapidly declining bee population and advancing “regenerative food systems necessary for long-term space missions” (Dvir, 2019). Together Oxman and her team created a light, humidity, and temperature-controlled environment with perfect nutritional conditions that allows them to thrive year-around and change the queen bee’s biological cycle. In the next iteration of the project, they seek to 3D print chemically engineered pheromones that reveal more about how bees build their geometric hives, shedding light on how humans and bees can coexist in future cities with a symbiotic relationship.
