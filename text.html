          <h1 class="text-center"> Neri Oxman: Material Ecology</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
          The missing text I chose is titled <i>Neri Oxman: Material Ecology. </i>  The catalog was published in conjunction with
          <i> The Neri Oxman: Material Ecology </i>
          exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 2020. The book and collection were put together  by senior curator Paola Antonelli with project texts provided by Neri Oxman and the Mediated Matter team within the MIT Media Lab. In the book, Antonelli described how the conjunct Material Ecology exhibition is “not only about the future of architecture and design but also about the future role of the designer as the initiator of a process that exists within systems and ecologies, rather than as the form-giver of an object or the follower of functions” (Antoelli, 2020). The text provides a retrospection of Oxman's works from molecular designs to 16 feet structures. The work showcases her some exemplary projects that questioned and redefined organic design and material. Some of the projects featured in the book and exhibition include the Silk Pavilion, a 3D structure made from a single thread of fabricated silk around steel that guided how thousands of silkworms spin their silk; Aguahoja, a pavilion that utilized novel water-based fabrication platform technology to prints organic structures with programmed decay; Glass I, an additive manufacturing process for 3-D printing optically transparent glass structures at architectural dimensions to propose that glass can be used both as structural and functional component to support weight and light filter. Since the projects are unique in their process, material, and functionality, I have decided to focus on Aguahoja, a project that focuses on an organic plastic alternative that responds and decays with its environment.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>The Aguahoja project includes three artifacts: an architectural pavilion, a library of material experiments, and the software and hardware used to build it. The idea originated from the biblical phrase: “Dust to dust.” “[T]he group has spent … 4 years developing large scale water-based artifacts that could be subjected to water-induced degradation as well as the fabrication platform for constructing these artifacts” (Ling, 2018). The process starts with selecting polymers that are abundant in nature and understanding how they contribute to the whole structural integration as well as function needs. Chitosan, pectin, and cellulose are chosen since they are the most abundant materials in the world, and they are active in the decay cycle to disintegrate with water. Because of the complexity and unique manipulation of each polymer, the team first isolated and studied chitosan. From 2014 to 2016, the lab generated “dozens of prints using gradations of only chitosan and water. From 2016 - 2018, the material palette was expanded to include cellulose, pectin, and additives'' (Ling, 2018). All material that was made with the different concentrations of chitosan, cellulose, pectin was perseverated as part of the project library for documentation and future reference.  </p>
          <br>
          <p> The final product of the process is a 16 feet pavilion with sheets of biochemically engineered biopolymers that are responsive to the environment. The panel of the final pavilion is made from 3,000 shrimp shells as the main source of chiton, 5,000 fallen leaves as the main source of cellulose, and 6,000 apple skins as the main source of pectin. When first extruded by the robot, the structure was 80% water. Building the pavilion required a water-based digital fabrication machine created by the Mediated Media Lab in 2014. The machine prints in a grid like fashion with gaps and intersections. The team created software that accounts for the stress points of the structure along with the environmental factors of the  installation location such as light, humidity, and wind. Oxman and her team made sure that water evaporation will preserve the structure while still allowing the structure to decay once it is submerged in water. Because the material consists of synthetically created organic biopolymers, the extraction of water from the skin of the pavilion can cause it to harden and become less flexible and prolonged  light exposure  can also make the material have a darker hue. The skin is printed by the water-based digital fabrication machine with a base layer of apple pectin and chitosan and a top layer of chitosan and cellulose. The fabrication process does not require a hand drawn grid and detailed instructions for where and what to print. Instead, the fabrication robot uses a stiffness graph to generate the printing map. Nozzle sizes, pressure, speed, and molecular mixture are carefully calibrated for all different uses from producing  a strong structural chitosan streak to a thin pectin film. Creating the future takes time and dedication. The final build was a five meters tall pavilion composed of biocomposites constructed with varying degrees of stiffness, flexibility, and opacity. The design accounts for light exposure, how water would travel on the instructure, and as well as a graceful decomposition that would enrich its environment. </p>
          <br>
          <p>The success of the Aguahoja project allowed the team to continue to its second iteration, focusing on adding microorganisms that can exist within the panels to capture carbon and enhancing the facade with nature’s vibrant dyes. Aguahoja is a turning point in imagining the futurity of a building and how it can decay to enrich its environment. While growing buildings from trees and growing trees from buildings can seem like an idea of science fiction, Aguahoja exists to prove that large structures can be built  to respond  to its environment, be produced from nature’s most abundant resources, and enrich its environment at the end of its life cycle. </p>
